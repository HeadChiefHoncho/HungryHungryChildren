# Things We Didn't Get To

There were a couple of features we would have liked to implement with this game project. Firstly, the game itself is rather large and can take a lot of time to download and run, depending on your machine. Spending more time on efficiency would greatly benefit this project, which suffered from very few people as part of the group (this class's project was supposed to have 5 members per group) and a short time table.

The level variety is pretty good, with the first level serving as a tutorial and the following two expanding on the game's mechanics. However, 3 levels is hardly a full gaming experience and adding more level variety would greatly benefit Hungry Hungry Children.
